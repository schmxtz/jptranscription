'''
Some notes to this mapping:
    - The character "t" is a little troublesome because it's pronunciation relies somewhat on the preceding characters
        -> If the preceding character is a short vowel, it is pronounced "ット" in "ベット" (Bett)
        -> If the preceding character is anything else, like a long vowel or consonant it is just "ト"
            like "ブロート" (Brot)
